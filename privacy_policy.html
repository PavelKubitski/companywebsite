1. Introduction
PAVEL KUBITSKI built the CURL app as a Freemium app. This SERVICE is provided by PAVEL
KUBITSKI at no cost and is intended for use as is.
2. Information Collection and Use
We collect certain data, including Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), session duration, purchases, and

3. Log Data
When the app encounters an error, we collect data via third-party products called Log Data,
including IP addresses, device information, app settings, and error details.
4. Cookies
Although our app does not directly utilize cookies, third-party libraries integrated into the app may do

Third parties have limited access to user data, strictly to fulfill these purposes, and are obligated to
protect this information.
6. Security
We implement standard industry practices to secure user information. However, we cannot
guarantee absolute security, as no digital transmission or storage method is completely secure.
7. External Links
The app may contain links to external websites. We have no control over external sites' content,
privacy policies, or practices and advise reviewing these independently.
